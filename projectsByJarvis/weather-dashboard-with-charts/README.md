## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this project
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start using the application!

## Development
- For local development with live reload: `npm run dev` (requires live-server)
- For production build: `npm run build`

## Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture using React. The `App` component is the main container and renders other components such as `CurrentWeather`, `Forecast`, `HourlyForecast`, `WeatherChart`, and `LocationSearch`.  The `weatherService` module handles API calls to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).  Data fetched from the API is passed down as props to the relevant components.  Chart.js is used to create interactive charts based on the weather data.  The application uses a unidirectional data flow.  User input (e.g., location search) triggers API calls, updates the application state, and re-renders the UI.  Local storage is used to persist user preferences (location) across sessions.  Webpack bundles all the modules and assets into a single bundle for deployment.
